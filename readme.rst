Notes
*******************
This project was created as a case study and exam, and as such, we approached the same problems from various angles. Some functions that could be the same are made in two different ways, first for study purposes, second to demonstrate, and third to measure performance. As a result, there may be some inconsistency in the code. Additionally, there are some errors in the frontend that will be corrected in the future.
